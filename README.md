# FIP 2020 - Project Play
This is the final integrated project for semester two at Fanshawe College. The integrated project is building an advertising campaign and website for the Regional HIV/Aids Connection. The objective of this campaign is to create awareness around HIV/Aids for youth, aged 14 to 19. Project Play not only focuses on the enjoyment of sexual activity, but the education behind this action. Our campaign focuses on three main topics; safe sex, stigma, and testing. Project Play emphasizes these with the following taglines: Play Safe, Play Fair, and Play Smart.

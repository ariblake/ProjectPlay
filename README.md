# FIP 2020 - Project Play
This is the final integrated project for semester two at Fanshawe College. The integrated project is building an advertising campaign and website for the Regional HIV/Aids Connection. The objective of this campaign is to create awareness around HIV/Aids for youth, aged 14 to 19. Project Play takes a serious topic and aims to make it fun and engaging to learn about in order to appeal to youth. Our campaign focuses on three main topics; safe sex, stigma, and testing. Project Play emphasizes these with the following taglines: Play Safe, Play Fair, and Play Smart.
